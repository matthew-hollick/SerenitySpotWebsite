# File Structure Document

## Introduction

A well-organized file structure is essential in any software project as it not only supports efficient development and maintenance but also enhances collaboration among team members. For this project, the file structure is designed to accommodate the needs of a professional website for a massage therapist, developed using Hugo with the Hugo Story theme. The organization of the files aims to facilitate ease of content management, ensure optimal deployment, and support SEO best practices. This document provides a comprehensive view of the file organization, ensuring that any developer or contributor can easily navigate and understand the project's layout.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

This project utilizes Hugo, a static site generator, combined with the Hugo Story theme to create a visually appealing, one-page layout. The choice of tech stack directly impacts the file structure by separating content and presentation, utilizing Markdown for content management, and leveraging tools like Yoast SEO for optimization. Deployment is managed via platforms like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel, which are optimized for static sites. This structure supports a seamless integration of content updates, aesthetic modifications, and SEO enhancements.

## Root Directory Structure

The root directory forms the foundation of the project, containing essential directories that organize the project's components. Key directories include:

1.  **Site Configuration (config/):** Contains configuration files (e.g., `config.toml`) that store site-wide settings like base URL, theme configurations, and language settings.
2.  **Content Directory (content/):** Houses all the Markdown files, organized into subdirectories representing different site sections such as `home`, `services`, `about`, `contact`, `blog`, and `testimonials`. Each subdirectory contains the content file for the respective page.
3.  **Static Files (static/):** Includes all static resources like images, stylesheets, scripts, and other assets that do not change frequently and are served directly to the client.
4.  **Layouts (layouts/):** Contains HTML templates and layouts used by Hugo to render the content files into web pages. It often includes default templates and theme-specific overrides.
5.  **Themes (themes/):** Contains the Hugo Story theme files, including its own assets, layouts, and configurations.

Important files at the root level include `README.md` for documentation, and potentially `.gitignore` for version control.

## Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration files play a crucial role in defining how the site is built and behaves. The primary configuration file is `config.toml`, located in the root or a dedicated `config/` directory. This file manages global settings like base URL, theme configuration, and SEO parameters.

Environment-specific files might also exist, especially if deployment requires differentiation between development and production settings. These can include `.env` files or scripts that adjust settings based on deployment platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

## Testing and Documentation Structure

Testing and documentation are organized to support development quality and knowledge sharing. While Hugo projects are typically lightweight and static, testing could include browser testing scripts located in a `tests/` directory, ensuring compatibility across devices.

Documentation is crucial for ongoing maintenance and is typically contained within a `docs/` directory or included in `README.md` at the root, providing comprehensive guidance on setup, deployment, and content updates.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

The file structure of this Hugo-based website is meticulously organized to facilitate easy content management, efficient development, and holistic site optimization. This structure supports the project's aim of producing a user-friendly digital platform that effectively attracts and informs potential clients. With clear organization and thoughtful categorization, this file structure not only meets current needs but also remains flexible for future updates or expansions, distinguishing the project as both robust and adaptable.
